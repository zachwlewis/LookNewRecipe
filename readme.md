# Look! New Recipe!

_Look! New Recipe!_ is an AddOn for _World of Warcraft_ to aide both common crafters and recipe hunters in finding untrained recipes from vendors by displaying additional information unobtrusively when talking to vendors.

## Features

### Seamless Integration
_Look! New Recipe!_ adds two tabs to the bottom of the vendor window, unobtrusively displaying important information when looking for recipes.

### Meow
_Look! New Recipe!_ meows when the vendor sells an unlearned recipe, because it's cute as fuck.
